This resolution is the draft of an email from the TC to the Board DefCore
committee on the issue of identifying "required sections" of code.

The Technical Committee thanks the Board for requesting our assistance in
defining the requirements for usage of the OpenStack Trade Mark. This is
an important and complicated issue, so the Technical Committee feels that it
needs to be solved in stages. In order to improve the engagement of the
Technical Committee on this issue, we have selected Michael Still as our
representative to the "DefCore" subcommittee, with Anne Gentle as his backup.

The Technical Committee understands that the end goal of the Board is to
define criteria that can be used to define who shall be granted a license to
use the OpenStack Trade Mark. We understand that these criteria will be
defined per OpenStack release, and that there is therefore scope to
incrementally define the requirements over time.

There are a variety of stake holders in this discussion, and it is hard to
balance the requirements of those stake holders in the requirements definition
process.

The Technical Committee sees the stake holders as:

* end users -- end users care about interoperability of deployed OpenStack
  clouds. This interoperability is best measured by API testing, with
  tempest being a likely vehicle to drive such testing.

* deployers -- deployers want confidence that their OpenStack distribution is
  providing code that will be supported long term by the OpenStack community.
  Privately implemented features increase the risk to these deployments as
  they are reliant on a set of developers that is smaller than the entire
  OpenStack community.

* distributors -- distributors need the ability to differentiate their
  products, but they also need to be able to entice deployers away from other
  distributors. Therefore, we do not believe that private features are the
  right way for distributors to differentiate their products.

* developers -- the OpenStack development community is also an important part
  of the OpenStack ecosystem, and should be considered in this process. We
  feel that encouraging distributors and other employers of developers to
  engage with the upstream community is of value, and that the preference is
  for all code to end up going through our development process instead of
  being held in private.

We understand that the DefCore committee is intending the "defined sections of
code" requirement as a way of protecting deployers and developers from private
patches being held by distributors on critical sections of the OpenStack code.

However, addressing the needs of all of these stake holders is not possible
in the time available in the Icehouse release. Therefore, we have a preference
for a focus on ensuring that end users have a good experience with Icehouse
being the priority at this time. The Techonical Committee encourages the
DefCore committee to therefore focus on defining the set of API tests that a
compliant OpenStack should pass for this release.
